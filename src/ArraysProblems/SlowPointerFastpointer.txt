Slow pointer Fast pointer
--------------------------

Letâ€™s define the structure of the linked list or array as follows:

L = number of steps from the head to the start of the cycle.

C = length of the cycle.

M = number of steps from the cycle start to the meeting point.

T = total steps taken by the slow pointer until the meeting.

Let:

slow moves 1 step per iteration.

fast moves 2 steps per iteration.





proof that they meet if there is a cycle

The meeting point is guaranteed because:

1. The cycle is finite.

2. The fast pointer gains 1 step on the slow pointer per iteration.

3. After C iterations inside the cycle, the fast pointer will have gained C steps and thus must meet the slow pointer.


After L iteration,

Slow pointer is at - cycle starting point
Fast pointer is at - C%L

After C%L iterations fast pointer meet slow pointer at the same place where fast pointer was when slow pointer is at cycle start
