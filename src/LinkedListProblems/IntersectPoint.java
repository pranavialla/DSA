  The Two-Pointer Trick
    You initialize:

    p1 at the head of List A

    p2 at the head of List B

    Then:

    Traverse both lists one node at a time.

    When p1 reaches the end of List A, redirect it to the head of List B.

    When p2 reaches the end of List B, redirect it to the head of List A.

    Eventually, both pointers will either:

    Meet at the intersection node, or

    Reach the end (null) at the same time if there's no intersection.

    âœ… Why It Works
        Each pointer travels:

        p1: a + c + b

        p2: b + c + a

        So both pointers cover the same total distance. By switching heads after the first pass, they align their traversal paths.

        ðŸŽ¯ If there's an intersection:
        Theyâ€™ll meet at the shared node after a + b + c steps.

        ðŸš« If there's no intersection:
        Both will reach null after a + b steps and exit the loop.
