subarray: some continuous elements in the array .
    For example, lets take an array int arr=[10,20,30,40,50];

    -->Now lets see its various combinations:

      subarr=[10,20] //true
      subarr=[10,30] //false, because its not in contiguous form
      subarr=[40,50] //true

subset: some elements in the collection
    For example, lets take an array int arr=[10,20,30,40,50];

    -->Now lets see its various combinations:

      subseq=[10,20]; //true
      subseq=[10,30]; //true
      subseq=[30,20]; //false, because order isn't maintained

subsequence: in most case, some elements in the array maintaining relative order (not necessary to be continuous)
