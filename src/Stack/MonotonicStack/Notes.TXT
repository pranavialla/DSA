In NSE and NGE use nums.length as the case where there is no next greater element
In PSE and PGE use -1 as the case where there is no next greater element
these conditions help to subarray min, max, range calculations too and generaally also it makes sense


ðŸ”¹ Previous Elements (PSE / PGE)
We use >= for previous smaller and <= for previous greater because we want to include equal elements when looking backward.

This ensures stability in the stack: if multiple equal elements appear, we treat the earlier one as the "previous" reference.

It avoids skipping over duplicates that should be part of the subarray count.

ðŸ”¹ Next Elements (NSE / NGE)
We use > for next smaller and < for next greater to exclude equal elements when looking forward.

This prevents overcounting subarrays where the same value appears multiple times.

It ensures that each element is only counted once as the "next" boundary.



if we want to check any condition for all elements in the monolithic stack them if we add one more element in the main array
 1. at the begin if it is Previous (greatest| smallest)
 2. at the end if it is next (greatest| smallest)
 3. add min element in the array if we want smallest
 3. add max element in the array max if we wav greates
